# final-year-project
This project was my final year project for the third year of university. It utilised the webcam connected to a PC to recognise hand poses made by the user. The user would then be able to click on an input on the keyboard (for example, the letter 'A'), and that hand pose would be linked to the input. Whenever the user subsequently made that hand pose, the input (the letter 'A') would continuously be sent to the PC. The idea was to theoretically allow a user to play a game whilst only utilising hand poses and a form of input. It was developed in Python, using the open source MediaPipe API in order to aid in the hand recognition aspect of the code.

Please note: This repository contains specifically the code for the project and none of the virtual environment.

In order to run the project, download and extract the zip file named 'FinalProjectCode' from the link below:

Then, view the 'User_Guide' PDF which details how to run this Python project. A webcam is needed in order to get the project working. 
This project utilises a webcam which detects hands. This allows the user to create a hand pose with one hand, click a key on the keyboard and bind it to the hand pose. Whenever that handpose is then detected by the program, the key is entered into the PC.
